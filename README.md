# Seismic Event Detection

This file will serve as a tutorial to train and test AI models to perform Seismic Event Detection 

## Requirements
The following python packages are necessary to create a dataset and train a model (Versions included)
```
python=3.9
numpy=1.23.5
librosa=0.10.0
obspy=1.4.0
matplotlib=3.7.1
scipy=1.11.3
scikitlearn=1.3.1
torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.7 -c pytorch -c nvidia
pytorch version=1.31.1
```
The code has been tested on the following versions as well
```
python=3.9
numpy=1.24.4
librosa=0.10.1
obspy=1.4.0
matplotlib=3.9.0
scipy=1.11.3
scikitlearn=1.3.1
torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.8 -c pytorch -c nvidia
pytorch version=2.1.0
```
